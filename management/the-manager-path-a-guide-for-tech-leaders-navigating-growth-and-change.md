## Management 101

1. ### What to Expect from a Manager

   - Everyoneâ€™s very first experience of management is on the other side of the table, and the experience of being managed is the foundation on which you build your own management philosophy.
   - Types of Managers:

     - Benign Neglect managers, the engineer just kind of knows what to work on, and the manager just leaves them alone entirely. In the most extreme case, one person reported meeting only twice with his manager in the span of six months, one of those times to receive a promotion.

     - Micromanagers, who question every detail of everything you do and refuse to let you make any decisions on your own. Still worse are actively abusive managers who neglect you until they want to yell at you for something.

     - Managers who care about you as a person, and who actively work to help you grow in your career. Managers who teach you important skills and give you valuable feedback. Managers who help you navigate difficult situations, who help you figure out what you need to learn. Managers who want you to take their job someday. And most importantly, managers who help you understand what is important to focus on, and enable you to have that focus.
